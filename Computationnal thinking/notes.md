# unary notation
decimal
binary
ASCII --> character map most commonly used characters
UNICODE --> there are other encoding patterns with the most recent onec including emojis
Color represented dwith RGB --codes
videos are repeating still images
images can be presented using numbers
algorithms manage inputs converting them to outputs
algos can be computed into two axis time taken to solve the problem vs the size of the problem
time and size complexity applies whereby the impact to the algorithim completion time is insignificant even with an increase on the size of the algorithm
elements of algorithms
- functions() --> actions to be taken
conditionals() boolean conditions(1,0 answers) --> decisions to be made
iterrations --> actions that shuld be repeated
### Big-0 time notation
Big -O time notation can be used to explain how long a program takes to execute with the growth of input
Time complexity measures time taken whereas space complexity measure the amount of memory used
**Why use big 0**
Somettimes it can be a balance of the two factors for instance a tradeof can be done where space complexity is not a key issue
**How to calculate Big-0**
